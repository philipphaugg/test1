Problem Statement
Every year, funding agencies like the DFG (German Research Foundation) and ERC (European Research Council) allocate significant amounts of money to support new researchers. A substantial portion of this funding is used to purchase equipment necessary for setting up research labs and forming research groups. This system has been in place for decades, and although the funding bodies may change over time, the underlying process remains the same. Distinguished professors accumulate equipment over their careers, often amounting to several million euros per professor. While the value of this equipment depreciates over time, it remains fully functional due to regular use and maintenance by PhD students and scientific staff. However, when a professor retires, the equipment often becomes redundant for their successors, especially if they are from different research fields.
Real-life Examples
Example 1: My Principal Investigator (PI) had a colleague in the same research field who retired last year. He invited his friends, who are also professors, to take whatever equipment they could use. When we arrived, a large rubbish container was already outside the door, and everything that wasn’t taken was to be disposed of. We took as much as we could, but much still ended up as trash. Initially, we stored everything in an empty room, and over the last two years, we’ve used only a fraction of it, saving approximately y€. Quantifying the ecological impact of this reuse is challenging, but it’s evident that it prevented waste and conserved resources.
Example 2: In Kiel, two distinguished professors of physical chemistry have retired in the past two years, and their successors are still unknown. For one, the successor will be in a similar research field, so some to most of the equipment will be used by the new group. However, for the other, the new researcher will be from a completely different field, rendering around 0% of the equipment, valued at approximately xxx€, directly usable.
Broader Context
If we extrapolate this scenario to the German and European context, the numbers are staggering. There are countless (number?) chemistry professors and other researchers with highly specialized equipment that becomes obsolete for their successors. For example, the field of Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) technology sees a similar trend.
Current Solutions and Their Limitations
The current process for dealing with this surplus equipment is highly informal and inefficient. Typically, it involves calling friends within the research community, which is not a systematic or sustainable solution. This method lacks visibility and often results in functional equipment being discarded.
Our Proposed Solution
Our solution aims to address the inefficiencies of the current system. By providing visibility for surplus equipment through a dedicated platform, we can ensure that valuable resources are not wasted. This platform will act as a marketplace for second-hand scientific equipment, connecting retiring professors with new researchers who can benefit from their surplus resources.
Benefits
Enhanced Resource Utilization: By recirculating equipment within the research community, we can reduce waste and maximize the use of existing resources.
Cost Savings: New researchers can save significant amounts of money by acquiring functional equipment at a lower cost.
Environmental Impact: Reducing the disposal of functional equipment contributes to sustainability and reduces the ecological footprint of research activities.
Knowledge Transfer: This platform can facilitate the transfer of knowledge associated with the equipment, as retiring professors can provide insights and usage guidelines to new researchers.
Support for Underrepresented Research: By making equipment more accessible, we can support research areas that may not have significant funding but have the potential to make substantial scientific contributions.
Conclusion
The current linear process of funding and equipment acquisition in scientific research leads to significant waste. By introducing a platform to provide visibility and facilitate the recirculation of surplus equipment, we can create a more efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable system. This initiative not only conserves resources but also supports the continuity and advancement of scientific research.
